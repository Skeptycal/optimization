# Optimization
A collection of the state-of-the-art Optimization Algorithms.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tompollard/phd_thesis_markdown.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tompollard/phd_thesis_markdown)  
	
- Mathematical foundations of optimization: Optimization problems, local/global minima, optimality conditions, convexity
- Unconstrained optimization: gradient descent, conjugate gradients, Newton's method, quasi-Newton methods
- Constrained optimization: Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, Lagrange multipliers
- Linear programming: Simplex method, interior point methods
